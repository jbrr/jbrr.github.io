[{"content":"2020 was awful in a loud, bombastic way that (almost) everyone could agree on. There was a certain comfort in the idea that as terrible as it was, we were all in it together. 2021 has been awful in a much more insidious, isolated way, where everyone seems to feel like they\u0026rsquo;re suffering alone.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had a shit year. Like a really, truly, awful year. The isolation of last year set the stage for all sorts of warning signs of mental illness going unnoticed. These things tend to have a domino effect as well, as one person\u0026rsquo;s mental health effects everyone around them. I haven\u0026rsquo;t just seen this in folks I know personally, but just think about the rise of QAnon, or videos of folks toppling displays at Target because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to wear a mask. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to laugh at this stuff, but it seems very likely to me that most of these folks are in crisis. They need empathy and help, not ridicule.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what to do about any of this besides encourage folks to watch for warning signs. Depending on the illness, the earlier it\u0026rsquo;s recognized, the less destructive it\u0026rsquo;ll end up being. Changes in personality shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be overlooked, nor should changes in mood, appetite, or sleep. Please, visit nami.org and find help in your area if you\u0026rsquo;re experiencing any of these warning signs, or if someone you love is. It might be a little bit scary to reach out to someone, but I promise it\u0026rsquo;s not nearly as scary as leaving it untreated.\n","permalink":"https://jbrr.dev/posts/20211104/","summary":"2020 was awful in a loud, bombastic way that (almost) everyone could agree on.
