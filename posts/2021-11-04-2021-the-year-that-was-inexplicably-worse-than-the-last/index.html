<p>I&rsquo;ve had a shit year. Like a really, truly, awful year. The isolation of last year set the stage for all sorts of warning signs of mental illness going unnoticed. These things tend to have a domino effect as well, as one person&rsquo;s mental health effects everyone around them. I haven&rsquo;t just seen this in folks I know personally, but just think about the rise of QAnon, or videos of folks toppling displays at Target because they don&rsquo;t want to wear a mask. It&rsquo;s easy to laugh at this stuff, but it seems very likely to me that most of these folks are in crisis. They need empathy and help, not ridicule.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to do about any of this besides encourage folks to watch for warning signs. Depending on the illness, the earlier it&rsquo;s recognized, the less destructive it&rsquo;ll end up being. Changes in personality shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked, nor should changes in mood, appetite, or sleep. Please, visit <a href=https://nami.org/Home title=nami.org>nami.org</a> and find help in your area if you&rsquo;re experiencing any of these warning signs, or if someone you love is.
