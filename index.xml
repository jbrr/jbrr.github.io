      <description>2020 was awful in a loud, bombastic way that (almost) everyone could agree on. There was a certain comfort in the idea that as terrible as it was, we were all in it together. 2021 has been awful in a much more insidious, isolated way, where everyone seems to feel like they&amp;rsquo;re suffering alone.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a shit year. Like a really, truly, awful year. The isolation of last year set the stage for all sorts of warning signs of mental illness going unnoticed.</description>
